What is wireframe ?
A wireframe is a basic visual representation or sketch of a web page,
mobile app, or software interface. It outlines the layout, structure,
and placement of elements, but it doesn't include design details like colors
or images. It serves as a blueprint for web or app development.

What is mockup ?
A mockup is a visual representation or prototype of a design, 
often used in the early stages of a project to demonstrate the layout, 
structure, and visual elements of a web page, application, or product. 
Mockups are typically static and do not contain functional elements like buttons or 
links. They help stakeholders visualize the design before actual development or production begins.

Difference between scripting and programming language ?

A scripting language is typically used for automating tasks, controlling software applications, and 
often interpreted rather than compiled. It focuses on specific tasks and interactions.
A programming language, on the other hand, is more comprehensive and can be used to create full-fledged
software applications. It usually involves compilation and provides more control over the computer's hardware.

What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification. It is the basis for several programming languages,
with JavaScript being the most well-known. The ECMAScript specification defines the syntax and semantics of the language, 
ensuring consistency and compatibility among different JavaScript engines and implementations.
