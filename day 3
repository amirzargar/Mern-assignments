1.URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. 
It typically consists of a protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), domain name, and 
optional path.

2.Difference between HTTP and HTTPS:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is unsecured, while HTTPS 
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is secured. HTTPS encrypts data during 
transmission, providing a more secure connection, which is crucial for 
sensitive information like passwords and payment details.

3.DOM (Document Object Model):
DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a
document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to dynamically update content, structure, and style.

4.Meta Tags:
Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a document. They include 
information such as character encoding, viewport settings, description, and keywords.
Meta tags are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document.

5.W3C (World Wide Web Consortium):
W3C is an international community that develops web standards to ensure the long-term growth
of the Web. It establishes guidelines and specifications for technologies like HTML, CSS, and more.

6.Different Doctypes of Different Versions of HTML:
For HTML5, the doctype is <!DOCTYPE html>.
Earlier versions had different declarations, such as 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"> for HTML 4.01.
